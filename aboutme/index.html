        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <img alt="Image of me, Jacob Litster!" src="images/Jacob 2020.jpg"  style="width:139px;height:186px;">

        <h2>Jacob Litster</h2>
        
        <h2>People typically call me "Jacob", "Jake", or my online username: "Jarie 水栓" (read Jarie Suisen, usually shortened to just Jarie).</h2>
        
        <p>Career: I still don't have a particular career in mind. I started BYU Pathway in 2019 and am now on my third certificate. 
            My first two were "Project Management" and "Marriage, Family, and Human Relations" and I decided my third should be something I might be able to put into a job so I am taking "Web and Computer Programming."
        </p>
        
        <p>Hobbies: I am a nerd with a love for many series! 
            I enjoy many (hundreds) novels, comics, tv shows, movies, podcasts, music, tabletop games, video games, and more! 
            However, I seem to be deceptively picky about what I like (which can be a bit frustrating for other people).
            <ul>
                Books: I am a bit picky about the books I read. 
                Some novels I enjoy:
                <li>Xanth (series), Animorphs (series), Magic Kingdom for Sale/Sold (series), Oz (series; seriously, so many people don't know L. Frank Baum wrote 14 books! The well-known live-action movie is a terrible depiction of such a wonderful story...)</li>
                <br>
                
                I love many manga and anime from Japan. 
                I have imported many manga series, filling numerous bookshelves! 
                I can't stand watching anything dubbed-over with another language. 
                Just let me hear the original voices with subtitles!<br>
                Some Manga and Anime I enjoy:
                <li>School Rumble, Frieren: Beyond Journey's End, Naruto, Yotsuba&!, Pokémon Special (or Pokémon Adventures, in English)</li>
                <br>
                English comics I enjoy are mostly found online, rather than physical print (though I do order physical copies when I can)
                Some of them include:
                <li>How to be a Mind Reaver, Rusty & Co., Proper Care and Feeding for your Fountain, inSecurity</li>
                <br>
                
                I don't play very many tabletop/card games, since they generally require a lot of physical materials and constantly putting more money into them for new content. 
                However, these are some of my favorites:
                <li>Dungeons and Dragons 5e (typically as the Dungeon Master running the game)</li>
                <li>Call of Cthulhu (as the Keeper of Arcane Lore running the game)</li>
                <li>Magic the Gathering (I love this game, though I haven't been able to afford newer cards in a few years)</li>
                <li>Zombicide (A fun zombie apocalypse game my brother has where everyone works together to survive and escape)</li>
                <br>
                
                I love so many video games! 
                Though, they are almost exclusively on Nintendo consoles or on PC (mostly via Steam). 
                Many are not in franchises and not well-known, so here are some of the franchises I like:
                <li>Pokémon, Borderlands, Sonic the Hedgehog, Metroid, Zero (aka: Fatal Frame), Super Smash Bros.</li>
                <br>
                
                Music that I love is almost exclusively Japanese. 
                I can't stand hearing the vast majority of radio music. 
                Some of my favorite musicians/bands are:
                <li>Japanese: Ayumi Hamasaki, Kotoko, Jo Hisaishi, JAM Project, ZUN (makes the main Touhou games, completely), Rica Matsumoto, GARNiDELiA</li>
                <li>English: Dragonforce, Lindby/BomBARDed</li>
                <br>

                For podcasts, I love stories! Whether it is a live-play of Dungeons and Dragons or an original story, that's what I want to hear!
                <li>Levar Burton Reads, BomBARDed, Total Party Kill, The End of Time and Other Bothers, Welcome to Night Vale (The first series that got me into podcasts)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Marriage: I am currently single, was divorced at the end of 2021. No children, though I hope to someday be sealed and have kids.
        </p>
        <p>
            Current work: I am currently unemployed (as of Jan. 11 2024). 
            I loved my last job, but there was a combination of things that were causing me to be concerned for my mental health and decided it was better to end on a good note than risk things degrading. 
            I haven't had any career behind my jobs so far, it's just been what jobs I could find out and would hire me.
        </p>
        <p>
            College Life, Degree: With these online classes, I love the accessibility! 
            Not having to travel really saves time and money and I have gotten to meet people from all over the world! 
            Do to not having a particular field I am focused on, the degree I am working towards is the Professional Studies BS, as it allows a custom selection of certificates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web Design: While I am taking this class as just part of my certificate, I am excited to learn more about how to make a webpage! 
            Years ago, I taught myself how to make a basic webpage so I could have a custom homepage for my most-used links. 
            While that is now a built-in option in some browsers, I would like to be able to make other web pages or other content should the desire or interest arise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Church Membership: I grew up in the church and was baptised when I was eight years old. 
            I don't have a particular favorite quote or scripture, though there are many that I love. 
            And all the quotes and scriptures I might pick have something good to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other: Hm... I like food. I'm not particularly picky, and I'm more likely to dislike certain condiments than a complete food. 
            I like American, Japanese, American-Chinese, American-Korean, Mexican, American-Mexican... I'll try a lot of things if I get the chance. 
            Fresh fruits and vegetables are great, though I'm not a fan of tomatos or green salads (but I'll still eat them).
